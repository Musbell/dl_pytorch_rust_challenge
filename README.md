# Exploring Deep Learning: Translating PyTorch to Rust using Burn

This repository documents my journey revisiting a deep learning course I previously completed in PyTorch. This time, for a creative twist, I'm translating the exercises and projects from Python into Rust with the help of Burn. As a newcomer to Rust, this project serves as a platform for learning and sharing my progress. I welcome any feedback and insights as I delve into the synergy between deep learning concepts and Rust's robust system-level capabilities. Join me in this learning adventure!
